<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Anatoliy Angelov. I'm 26 years old and I come from Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Ever since I was a little kid I was facsinated by computers. I studied Computer Scinece in a profesional highschool, however after that I decided to go into Electrical Engineering and got a bachelors in Electrical power engineering..</p>

<p>I've regained my passion for computers and coding in general and have been working really hard to improve and learn as much as I can.</p>
